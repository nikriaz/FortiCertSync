; FortiCertSync configuration
; ============================

[fortigate]
; Base URL of your FortiGate (GUI address). Use https and the correct port.
; Examples:
;   https://fg1.example.com
;   https://192.168.1.1:4443
baseUrl = https://fgt.example.com

; VDOM name. If VDOMs are OFF, this might be omitted or must be blank or "root".
vdom = root

; API key for the FortiGate API user.
; First run must use the plain text token. The app will verify it and then
; rewrite this value as DPAPI-encrypted: enc:<base64>
; IMPORTANT: The DPAPI encryption is per-user (CurrentUser). Run the app under
; the same account that will execute it on schedule, or switch the code to LocalMachine.
apiKey = PUT_YOUR_PLAIN_API_KEY_HERE_ON_FIRST_RUN

[certificates]
; Default Windows certificate store to search for all subjects below.
; Typical IIS/Win-ACME location is LocalMachine\My. Might be omitted for this default location.
store = LocalMachine\My

; List each subject you want synchronized. One subject per line.
; Wildcards are fine (e.g., *.example.com). The app will pick the newest valid
; certificate for that subject from the Windows store, compare to Forti, and
; if newer/absent it will UPDATE the Forti certificate in place (same name/slot).
subject = *.example.com
subject = *.example.net
