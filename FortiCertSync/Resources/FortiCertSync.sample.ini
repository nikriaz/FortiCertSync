; ============================
; FortiCertSync configuration
; ============================

[fortigate]
; Base URL of your FortiGate (GUI address). Use https and the correct port.
; Examples:
;   https://fg1.example.com
;   https://192.168.1.1:4443
baseUrl = https://fgt.example.com

; [OPTIONAL] VDOM name.
; If VDOMs are OFF, this may be omitted, blank, or "root".
; If VDOMs are ON, specify the target VDOM here.
vdom = root

; API key for the FortiGate API user.
; First run must use the plain text token. The app will verify it and then
; rewrite this value as DPAPI-encrypted: enc:<base64>
; IMPORTANT: The DPAPI encryption is per-user (CurrentUser). Run the app under
; the same account that will execute it on schedule, or switch the code to LocalMachine.
apiKey = PUT_YOUR_PLAIN_API_KEY_HERE_ON_FIRST_RUN

; Certificate name for automatic renewals.
; Section header must be [cert:<FortiGateCertName>].
; Example: [cert:example_A]
;
; Certificate name can include a suffix with a date in format _ddMMyyyy:
;   example_A_01022025
; The app will ignore the date part when matching.
;
; Workflow:
; - Retrieves the latest valid certificate for this name pattern from Forti.
; - Reads Subject (CN) and Issuer (O) from it.
; - Picks a matching certificate from Windows store.
; - If newer, imports into FortiGate as <name>_<ddMMyyyy>.
; - Rebinds references from the old cert to the new one.
; - Deletes the old cert if rebound was successful and no references remain.
[cert:example_A]

; [OPTIONAL] Windows certificate store to search.
; Default is LocalMachine\My (typical IIS/win-acme location).
store = LocalMachine\My

; [OPTIONAL] Override Subject to search in Windows store.
; Wildcards allowed, e.g. *.example.com.
subject = *.example.com

; [OPTIONAL] Override Issuer to search in Windows store.
; By default, Issuer (O) from Forti cert is matched against Windows Issuer.
; This parameter can override; it matches against Issuer (O) or Issuer (CN).
issuer = R11

; Minimal example:
; [fortigate]
; baseUrl = https://fgt.example.com
; apiKey = PUT_YOUR_PLAIN_API_KEY_HERE_ON_FIRST_RUN
;
; [cert:example_A]
; [cert:example_B]
